                    <p class="persom-p">Ado (born October 24, 2002) is a Japanese singer. Ado began singing as an utaite (an internet cover singer) on Niconico(japanese video-sharing site), after uploading a video of herself singing a cover of "Kimi no taion" on January 10, 2017.In late 2020, she exploded on the music scene with the release of "USSEEWA" Nvat just 17 years old. As of june 2023, it has over 275 million views on YouTube, and over 6.5 million plays with over twenty-five thousand mylists on Niconico. Since then, Ado has been garnering lots of attention when releasing new covers or original music.Ado has a versatile voice and is able to add power to it. Her vocals, seeming somewhat mature for her age, usually give off an angsty vibe, as of a rebellious teenager especially in some of her original/cover songs like "Odo" and "Crime & Punishment," where she best utilizes it. She uses growls to inject a gravely angst into her voice but can also belt a soft and clear falsetto on a dime. Not only that, but her vocal range itself aside from her techniques is astounding; displayed in "God-ish" to its fullest extent, Ado's latest measure of vocal range is from a low rumbling C3 banging all the way up through to an ear-piercing D6.</p>

                  <h3 class="person-h3">symbolism in Ado</h3>
                    <p class="persom-p">On Niconico, most of her covers' titles would have a pun that had something to do with her name "Ado." (for example. Adovance, Adorably, Adoventure, Adovice, Adornment)
                        In her earlier stages of singing covers, she sung in a closet.
                        Her name "Ado" originates from the term for the supporting actor of traditional Japanese comic theatre Kyogen. She chose to name herself after this instead of the main actor because her wish was to be a supporting character in someone's life through song. (see interview)
                        The blue rose often if not always displayed in her general media represents flower language. After finally being genetically-engineered by Japanese researchers in 2004, its flower language was changed from "impossible" to "dreams coming true". A term that resonates with Ado's personality.
